# Notes
* The Zoning Regulation of 2016:
    * This incorporates recent changes
    * This does not seem to separate out most parks. For example, Banneker is listed under RF-1 and Malcolm X Park is listed under RA-4. 
    * The National Mall and Rock Creek Park are separated out
* The FLUM data separates out parks. Here are the data categories:
    * RLD - Residential-Low Density
    * RMOD - Residential-Moderate Density
    * RHD - Residential-High Density
    * CLD - Commercial-Low Density
    * CMOD - Commercial-Moderate Density
    * CMED - Commercial-Medium Density
    * CHD - Commercial-High Density
    * INST - Institutional
    * FED - Federal
    * LPUB - Local Public Facilities
    * PROS - Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces
    * PDR - Production, Distribution, and Repair
    * Water
    * Mixed Uses
* Will use FLUM data given that parks can be separated out - filter out PROS, FED, and Water
